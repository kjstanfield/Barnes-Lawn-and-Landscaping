# Barns-Lawn-and-Landscaping
Website for Barns Lawn and Landscaping and also my final project for Code Louisville


Straightforward HTML/CSS/Javascript webpage.
No special instructions to load.
Hosted on github pages URL:

https://kjstanfield.github.io/Barnes-Lawn-and-Landscaping/


Also want to note that I have found the google map I created using the API is frequently blocked by popup blockers.
If the bottom of the page loads as blank this is likely the issue.
